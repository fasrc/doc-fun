# Project Overview: doc-generator

## Purpose
doc-generator is an AI-powered documentation generation system that supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI GPT and Anthropic Claude) to create high-quality technical documentation. Originally designed for Faculty Arts and Sciences Research Computing (FASRC), it features an extensible plugin architecture, multi-format support, and comprehensive quality assurance capabilities.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Generation**: OpenAI GPT and Anthropic Claude integration with customizable models
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible recommendation engines via entry points
- **Quality Assurance**: Algorithmic analysis and GPT-based quality evaluation
- **Multi-format Support**: HTML and Markdown output
- **Professional CLI**: Comprehensive command-line interface
- **README Generation**: Specialized generator for directory documentation

## Target Use Cases
- Technical documentation for HPC (High Performance Computing) environments
- Research computing documentation for FASRC
- Plugin-based recommendations for modules, datasets, and code examples
- Batch processing of documentation generation
- Quality assessment and multi-run compilation

## Current Version
v2.5.0 - Recently implemented Phase 1 foundation improvements including:
- Centralized configuration management with pydantic
- Structured error handling framework
- Intelligent caching layer
- Updated architecture for better maintainability
